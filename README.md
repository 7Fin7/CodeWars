## Codewars Katas

This repository contains my solutions to various [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges (katas), solved in Python and Java.

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, practice problem-solving, and improve coding skills.

##### Structure

`python/` → Python kata solutions

`java/` → Java kata solutions

##### Notes

Each file corresponds to a single kata solution.

Code is written to be simple, readable, and focused on solving the kata.
